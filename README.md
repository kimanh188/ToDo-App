## Description

This is my very first React project - a simple yet functional Todo App. The main features of the app include:

- **Header**: Displays the current date, weather (based on the city specified in the settings), and the username (also set in the settings).

- **Todo Section**: Shows the number of unfinished to-dos. It also includes a plus button that allows users to add new to-dos. Pressing the plus button again hides the input field.

- **Todo Item Interaction**: Clicking on a todo item focuses it and reveals a trash icon. This icon allows the user to delete the selected todo item.

- **Settings**: Users can set their name and city in the settings to personalize the header.
